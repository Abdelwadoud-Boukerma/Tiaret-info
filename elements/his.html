    <p>The province has been inhabited since antiquity, and there are numerous megalithic monuments. It served as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire">Roman</a> station and fort, Tingartia. Near Tiaret are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedars">jedars</a>, which are ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleum">mausoleums</a>. The edifices demonstrate that the area was inhabited during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_antiquity">Late Antiquity</a> by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers">Berber</a> tribe(s) that could build in stone.</p><hr>

    <p>Tiaret grew up as a site under the domination of small Berber tribal kingdoms; the first of these being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rustamid_dynasty">Rustamid dynasty</a> between 761 and 909 when Tiaret served as the capital of the area. However, this capital may have been 10 km (6 or 7 miles) west of the present-day Tiaret. It was first founded by Abd al-Rahman Rustamid, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibadi_Islam">Ibadi</a> theologian from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Iran">Greater Iran</a>. Tiaret was said to be relatively free-thinking and democratic, being a centre for scholarship that permitted a wide range of sects and movements, notably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%CA%BFtazila">Mu'tazila</a>. There were many <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews">Jews</a> living in the area until at least the 10th century, including the scholar and doctor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_ibn_Kuraish">Judah ibn Kuraish</a> who became the doctor to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emir">Emir</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fez,_Morocco">Fes</a>.</p>
    <p>Tiaret occupies a strategic mountain pass at 3,552 feet (1,083 m), and was thus a key to dominating the central <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghreb">Maghreb</a>. Later, from the start of the 8th century, it was the key northern terminus of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa">West African</a> branch of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Africa">slave</a> trade. As such, it offered a lucrative income from taxes on the trade, and was a desirable prize</p>

    <p>The Rustamid empire, which during the reign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Rahman_ibn_Rustam">Abdurrahman</a> (766–784) and his son <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Wahhab_ibn_Abd_al-Rahman">Abdul Wahab</a> (784–823) extended over the greater part of the modern Algeria, was known as the Ibadite Empire from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdallah_ibn_Ibad">Abdallah ibn Ibad</a>, the founder of the sect to which Abdurrahman belonged. Seven princes of the Rustamite house succeeded Abdul Wahab until they were overthrown by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatimid_Caliphate">Fatimite</a> general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Abdallah_al-Shi%27i">Abu Abdallah al-Shi'i</a> in 909.</p><hr>
